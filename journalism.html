    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">From the inside: three UNC students recount the semester's lockdowns</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>When UNC Chapel Hill sophomore Emily Chambliss, 19, first hears the distant siren, it sounds like a car alarm. The dining hall walls muffle the far-off mechanic wail and she looks out the window, expecting to see flashing car lights. Instead she sees students scatter in dead-sprints for the nearest buildings. 
      Sam Klukas, 20 years old and a senior, sits staring at the classroom wall, half-listening to the guest speaker over Zoom and thinking about her tattoo consultation after class. She wants her cat’s paw print inked into her right hip — her cat's favorite spot to lay. A student interrupts the speaker. They say students online are posting about gunshots. 
      Tailei Qi, a 34-year old graduate student, shot associate professor Zijie Yan seven times. At 1 p.m., Aug. 28, the sixth day of the semester, the campus-lockdown alert is sent to every phone on the UNC Chapel Hill campus. Behind the barricaded dining hall doors, Chambliss sits with her laptop balanced on her knees and works online with co-workers of The Daily Tarheel to break the story. 
      Across campus, Lilly “Tiger” Nekervis, 20, talks with friends at their frequent study spot: the large and brightly lit Frank Porter Graham Union building basement. Her friend across the table looks up from her phone, pale. The basement’s constant thrum of conversation falls away as more phones light up with the notification. Heads look up, catching each other’s glances from across the wide open space. 
      “It’s hard seeing how quickly everything went silent. It was just terror,” Nekervis said. “Some people couldn’t move. I grabbed them out of chairs, grabbed my friends and I said let’s go.” 
      In the School of Education, Klukas and the rest of her class shove desks and chairs against the door and cover the windows. Then they sit in dark silence and wait as their phones flash white one by one in a flurry of texts. Klukas has experienced two school lockdowns before college. By the end of September, the number will increase to four. 
      With nowhere to hide in the open basement, Nekervis leads students to the underground maintenance tunnel. Nekervis said back in quarantine she explored the empty buildings at night and knew the tunnels existed. 
      “In my mind, that was the safest place. So I said let’s go there,” she said.
       10 of them pile into a pitch dark janitorial closet the size of a cubicle. 
      “We held each other and we cried,” Nekervis said. “We were in that closet packed in like sardines for about three hours. And yeah, we were freaking out the whole time.”
      The rumors quickly spread online that there were several shot dead, that there were two assailants and wrongful arrests. Ignoring the alarming posts flooding Yik Yak and group chats, Nekervis finds out the shooting had taken place in Caudill Labs two buildings away. Klukas, surrounded by classmates trying to tune into EMT signals and the police radio, finds the same information in addition to Qi’s description and his car license plate. Though there was nothing to do with the information except pass it along to concerned family members and friends. 
      Klukas said she almost cried twice in the lockdown. Once when she couldn’t get in contact with her friend in Caudill Labs and when her mother sent a message using voice-to-text. 
      “I told her what was going on and she said ‘ok baby love you’, but she didn’t realize it was still recording. So right after that is what she must have said to my dad: ‘oh god oh god what if she gets hurt’. That one was rough,” Klukas said. 
      Nekervis said she struggled with what to tell her parents. “The hardest part is knowing there are people caring for you and worried for you, and you can’t tell them you’re fine if you aren’t,” she said. 
      At 4:30 p.m. the lockdown is still in effect and the cramped group of students face a new problem – there is no bathroom. “It was a janitorial closet, so there was a hose and a drain and stuff, and we were in there for so long,” Nekervis said. She covers her face. “The only thing we could do was laugh.”
      Eventually faculty and police began to evacuate buildings and found the students in the custodial closet. Nekervis said when she finally made her way to the main floor, her body aching from the hours spent curled in a corner, she saw more police officers and news media than she had ever seen in her life. News cameras swiveled from face to face and reporters fired off questions to any student willing to speak. 
      “I cried on my way out the building,” Nekervis said. She arrived back at her apartment at 5:30 p.m., kissed her lizard Pengu, and called her parents. Her off-campus apartment is small but tidy and decorated with pastels and fake plants. Every room is well-lit with curtains drawn tight over the windows. Two corgi-lamps stand guard on either side of her bed.
      “I catch myself at night thinking there is someone in the dark,” Nekervis said.
      Chambliss described the walk back to her dorm as something from a movie. Every student she passed looked shocked, but undeniably fine. “I think it was the reality that it actually happened that scared people more than the actual situation,” she said. 
      Klukas returned to her apartment with the help of a friend, unable to reach her own car in the chaotic traffic. “I held my cat. I dissociated for two hours. Then I drove to Asheville,” she said.
      Students organized a March for Our Lives protest the day after the lockdown. Nekervis said while the message was impactful, she feared the march drew attention away from the actual tragedy of the day. 
      “It wasn’t a school shooting. They were calling it a school shooting and it wasn’t. It was a targeted attack on a professor, and the professors have been having a very hard time with that,” she said. 
      In the days following the lockdown, a large majority of students left for home and a quiet, awful energy fell around campus, according to Chambliss. 
      “You could walk past the window and see the bullet hole in the glass. A lot of people didn’t know him personally, but he was an integral part of the campus that all of us have so much love for. Something horrible shook everything, you know?” she said. 
      By Wednesday, classes were canceled for the week and a candlelight vigil for Yan was held on Aug. 30. 
      Once the student body moved on from fear, they turned bitter. “A lot of the students were so scared and angry at the situation and their helplessness in the situation, that they turned a lot of their anger towards the university. I don’t think all of it was fair,” Chambliss said. 
      Even after students began to heal, effects from the lockdown still lingered in unexpected ways. The Daily Tarheel gained international attention and Chambliss said even more surprising was the support from their rivals, Duke. Yet despite the overwhelming encouragement from the outside world, Chambliss noted an unshakable fear still held the school. “We were scared that it would happen again. And it did,” she said. 
      On Sept. 14, Mickey Harris, 27, walks into the campus restaurant Alpine Bagel in the middle of lunch rush and threatens the manager with a gun. Students fled in mad panic. He doesn’t fire the weapon, but just 16 days after the first lockdown, the UNC Chapel Hill campus went into a second lockdown. 
      Klukas sits in the same classroom in the same chair, though now positioned to face the door instead of the wall. Just prior to class beginning, she joked with her classmate about drinking three bottles of water. 
      “I said hey, maybe I should go to the bathroom before class in case we have another lockdown,” Klukas said. 
      In the middle of class the news about Harris reaches Yik Yak. The professor waits 15 minutes until the official alert before she puts the class in lockdown. Students help move the heavy boxes from beside the door to in front of it. The boxes have been there since classes resumed, and no one touched them until today. 
      Chambliss was just finishing her lunch in the dining hall when the lockdown-alert pinged her phone. She said the first emotion she felt wasn’t fear, but exasperation. 
      “It shouldn’t have happened once and it really shouldn't have happened twice,” she said. 
      When Nekervis applied for the sales associate position at Carolina Performing Arts, she asked what the protocol was for a lockdown. She never used to ask that question. During her second shift Nekervis looks out the window and sees students running. She crawls under her work desk and curls into a tight ball for the entirety of the lockdown. She didn’t move or speak, not even to her nonchalant co-workers trying to lift her spirits. 
      Klukas said she felt afraid in the classroom, but not panicked. Several students including herself began working on assignments. “I was just desensitized I think,” Klukas said. “I’m collecting lockdowns like Pokémon cards.”
      The professor refuses bathroom runs for students and after an hour and a half of the familiar tense waiting, Klukas gives up. She arranges desks to block off the corner of the room and finds a bucket. 
      “Everyone pretended they didn’t see what I was doing. It was so quiet though. I was so embarrassed. I’m just glad I wasn’t wearing my overalls,” she said.
      Despite knowing their safety was never critically endangered, Nekervis and Klukas said some things are hard to move on from. They have both picked up new habits and fears. For every new job, Klukas asks about the lockdown protocol and regularly gets nauseous when she enters that classroom or sees her seat. Nekervis struggles to walk to her car alone after a closing shift. 
      “I’m afraid of the dark now,” Nekervis said. She never used to be. 
      “I’m afraid of that fucking chair,” Klukas said before dropping her smile. “I’m afraid of guns too.”
      Chambliss claims she has no lasting fears from the lockdowns, but said she, like many students, are struggling against the reality that their experience with lockdowns might be far from over. 
      “If two lockdowns in one semester isn’t indicative of a serious problem in this country, I don’t know what is,” she said.

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Workers of Asheville Rally for Union for All</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>A mass of underappreciated and overly exhausted workers gather in the confines of Pack Square to rally for labor unions and workplace security. 

      “We continue to see workplace violence. We continue to see disparity in pay. We continue to see a lack of basic supplies,” said Hannah Drummond, a front line nurse of Mission Hospital.
      
      On Thursday, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) hosted its annual gathering of working peoples to rally in solidarity with North Carolina nurses demanding fair contracts and improved working conditions. 
      
      Without a safe and secure working environment, nurse retention rates are plummeting and harming patients in the crossfire as a result of overworked healthcare professionals. Yet the Healthcare Distribution Alliance is slow to improve hospital working conditions. “They need to invest in getting the resources we need because this community deserves it,” said Drummond, a board member of the AFL-CIO. 
      
      But the demands do not stop with the nurses. Kayla Koehlmoos, an electrician of five years and delegate of the Charlotte-Metrolina Labor Council says that every working person can benefit from unionizing. 
      
      “We’re rallying in solidarity on behalf of the working class coming together and getting what's ours,” said Koehlmoos. By creating a union within the workplace, workers are given the rights to bargain for job security, decent wage and necessary comforts. “It just allows you to have some kind of power over management.”
      
      Mikeya Jones, a representative of the Communications Workers of America, says her company is already organized and she wants to see others follow suit. “We’re here to fight for good contracts, healthcare, safe working conditions for all working people,” said Jones.
      
      The Asheville Food and Beverage United (AFBU) is a coalition led by workers fighting to educate, support, and advance service workers within Asheville. Jen Hampton, the leading committee chair, announced to the gathered masses that the AFBU has finally become a trade union, strengthening their power and securing resources for the service workers of Asheville. Jen Hampton encourages the cheering crowd to support the National Nurses United in their efforts to gain the same power. 
      
      Drummond says the National Nurses United do not plan on stopping the fight anytime soon. “We bargain our contracts next year. The HDA better be ready to meet our demands, or we will take to the streets.”
