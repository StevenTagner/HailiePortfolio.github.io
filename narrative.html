    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Shoveling Rot</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>Yeah, the dump grounds beyond the city. You heard trees are buried there, did you? Big oaks buried under the mounds? I’ll tell you about the dump lands. There are no trees in the dump lands. Never was, and as sure as this drink is warm piss, there will never be again. The waste sits and steams in the winter and warms into rancid sludge when summer comes round. My neighbor lost her dog there to an acidic patch – the shit gave the poor bastard cancer. I know she was stupid to do it. What reason could drive her from wherever she came from, blind her to the red signs and barbed gates, cross the dead plains of rotted corn, and hop the wooden fence? There is only the thick air that touches your skin with its wetness, the light towers that stay dark, and the sea of a mess the eyes won’t comprehend. I work as a shoveler. 
      No, the shit stopped being actual shit a long time ago. The Big Guys dump what they swallow, sewage, heaps of trash bound by rot and fishing net. Books swollen with mold or what’s left of the ashes pasted to broken rusted machinery. This burn on my arm, look at it, look at it boy. The shiny bits are tar. I shoveled plastics as they melted in the heat. Got nicked. What, you got a scar too? That is a papercut. No, listen to me. You aren’t listening. They nearly took my arm, boy. They said it would have to be cut below the elbow. The guys in the light towers said they’d pay the cost of one fancy new arm. The kind with a hand, with the fingers and grip strength. I read the pamphlet. Folks came by the hospital to take our picture together before anyone told me the surgery’s cost. I wouldn’t pay it. Couldn’t. The guys in the light tower shrugged and scheduled a performance review in six months. Years later I’m still shoveling with this arm, aren’t I? The pain doesn’t mean nothing, not while I can say I showed them, yeah? But next to my bud’s leg, you and I got paper cuts to be grateful for. You know he once got Jodie June’s signature, what? What did you say? Robots? 
      You fucker, you’re a funny fuck. They tried robots, they built a field’s worth of the metal freaks and filled the empty buckets with that fancy program. Us, the shovelers still made of meat and bones, we taught the buckets the real stuff. They paired us together like school kids learning shapes. R-263 was my buddy. Taught it to shovel, taught it to layer down the mounds one heap at a time or otherwise the mess won’t set right, and that’s how the sinkholes happen. R-263 asked me how long someone goes waiting in a sinkhole before they’re pulled out. Didn’t think I’ve ever had to explain the worth of replaceable parts to a replaceable part before. Then one day the robots started refusing little repairs. R-263 rejected each bolt and vomited the oil I gave it, until he died with the others. They worked themselves to a pile of parts. The only greater mass suicide I’ve seen like it was the war. But you didn’t sit down to talk about that. 
      The Big Guys learned people like us could be more forgiving than thoughtless metal men, they don’t feel hunger. And I don’t mind the work. The work is rhythmic, easy to fall into. Rotted food gets dumped by the pile and needs to be leveled down. Move quick and wear a scarf round the face, the flies can blacken the ground and will crawl into your eyes if they can. Grey jam riddled with maggots will drip from the shovel, but I’ll tell you what I told R-263, even though it didn’t care about maggots or the smell — I make it easier by thinking of the food it would’ve been, who it might’ve fed, if not the Big Guys. Lift your mind from your head and you’ll get on fine. 
      On a day without smoke a bird might circle above but the smell keeps them from landing, there’s nothing to eat if they did. Jodie June got lucky, she came to visit on a day without smoke. A sweaty guy in a blazer drove her from the lot to the fifth light tower in a golf cart. Suited doers and folks carrying cameras came with her. One suited doer set a mat down on the sticky black asphalt chewed like gum then shit out in long logs. I shoveled those logs into flat road again, the road Jodie June touched with her toes and sniffed at.
      “Oh, how lovely to see so many hard workers,” Jodie June said to the shovelers of Dune Thirty-Five, plus a few mulchers from the next dune curious to see the real Jodie June. Her white pants were cuffed above the white kitten heel and she wore a black tank top, neatly soiled. I imagine one of the doers brushing it down with brown powder at  the wooden fence. I didn’t stand with them, not for the work’s sake, no. Shoveling gets to your head sometimes, gives your body something to do while your mind runs or sometimes has no reason to move at all, but the point was I had nearly leveled the pile and Jodie June wasn’t worth the effort of finding the rhythm again. She autographed some discolored handkerchiefs until the folks with cameras moved her aside and handed her a shovel. Without all of us scuffing and clanging at once, her lone shovel was the star of the show as it scraped through sewage. 
      She spoke to the cameras in that TV voice of hers. The tinkling kind that lifts the vowels and stretches those sweet a-s into ah-s. “Hello darlings, as I’m sure you have already noticed, I am sparkle-less. Yes, I know! Today I have bravely set aside my shine, yes, even the Tiffany's Mosaic Collection necklace, to guide your beautiful lucrative attention here, to this issue which weighs so heavily on my heart – oh GOD. What is that? Fucking Christ what is that!” She screamed. I’ll say it, I did stop shoveling to watch her jump in the arms of a security guard. Her shovel laid against the rest of the rotten food, blade-deep in a torso’s ribcage. I could tell the moment she recognized the human nature of the nipples and screamed herself hoarse. The flesh had the soft nearly digested look we get from the Big Guys. This torso in particular was headless, not uncommon to see. Strips of skin caught on the garbage and tore like large wet scabs. My buddy with the leg swears he stood close enough to smell her soap, and she looked him dead in the eyes while the suited doers and suited gents from the light towers talked regulation and NDAs. He swears she looked from him to the sky,  and she said “What pretty birds,” with that TV smile of hers. The doers agreed, the gents agreed, and they agreed with her all the way to a golf cart. How lucky we must be to have pretty birds. Now I never saw any video of Jodie June shoveling in the dump lands, but I did see her commercial for saving the black-footed ferret. You know boy, she looked happy to cradle baby ferrets in her shimmery jacket, who am I to scold her for it.
      Some weeks before the cancer found the old dog’s heart, I had my neighbor over for drinks. She stared out the window towards her house and only looked away to refill her glass. “I’m waiting for my brother,” she said while she scrutinized the road. “He’s found work in the dump lands. Don’t you shovel there? How do you like it?” My neighbor finally looked at me and smiled a Jodie June TV smile. I told her about the pretty birds. Sure, boy, judge me for not telling her all I’ve told you. What good would that have done? I think about her when I shovel dog tags, I think about the brother she must have gone looking for. Should I have told her, you think? The light towers stay dark, and it doesn’t matter if her brother is just stuck with a shovel or got swallowed and shit back out, the Big Guys’ll work him to a second death. His ghost works alongside mine. Suppose I had told her, do you think she still would have taken along the old dog?
